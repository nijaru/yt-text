# Memory Optimization: Audio Streaming Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the memory optimization refactoring that implements streaming audio processing. The previous implementation would load entire audio files into memory before processing, causing excessive memory consumption for long videos. The new approach uses streaming techniques to process audio in chunks, significantly reducing memory requirements and allowing transcription of much longer videos.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Streaming Audio Download

- Modified the `_download_audio` method in `transcription.py` to use streaming options with yt-dlp
- Added buffer size limits and progress monitoring during download
- Separated metadata extraction and actual download to optimize the process

### 2. Streaming Audio Processing

- Replaced librosa-based audio loading with pydub's streaming approach
- Created a custom `AudioStreamContext` class to manage resources efficiently
- Implemented chunk-by-chunk processing with immediate cleanup after each chunk
- Added aggressive memory management with CUDA cache clearing after each chunk

### 3. Real-time Progress Tracking

- Enhanced the gRPC server to provide accurate progress updates during transcription
- Created a thread-safe progress tracking system using queues
- Implemented separate download and transcription progress tracking
- Added error handling with detailed status reporting

### 4. Resource Management

- Implemented immediate cleanup of temporary files after use
- Added explicit memory cleanup with garbage collection after each chunk
- Created proper thread and resource management in the gRPC implementation

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Memory Usage**: Memory consumption is now proportional to the chunk size rather than the entire file size, allowing processing of longer videos without memory exhaustion.

2. **Improved Stability**: Less chance of out-of-memory errors or system crashes during transcription of large files.

3. **Better Monitoring**: Real-time progress tracking with differentiated download and processing phases.

4. **Resource Efficiency**: Immediate cleanup of temporary files and freed memory.

## Technical Details

### Streaming Download

The new download functionality uses yt-dlp's optimized settings:
- Smaller buffer sizes (1MB)
- Limited concurrent downloads
- Progress monitoring through callbacks

### Streaming Audio Processing

Audio processing now uses:
- pydub for streaming audio loading (5MB chunks)
- Context managers for proper resource handling
- Immediate cleanup of processed chunks
- Per-chunk memory cleanup

### Threading Model

The gRPC implementation uses:
- A dedicated transcription thread for background processing
- Thread-safe queues for progress communication
- Thread-local storage for result caching
- Proper error propagation through channels

## Dependencies Added

- pydub: For efficient audio streaming
- grpcio/grpcio-tools: Made explicit in requirements

## Future Enhancements

1. Implement disk-based caching for processed chunks to avoid reprocessing on retry
2. Add memory usage metrics collection to monitor improvements
3. Implement adaptive chunk sizing based on system memory availability
