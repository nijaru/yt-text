# Error Handling

- In `scripts/transcribe.py`, the error handling could be more specific. Currently, it catches all exceptions with a generic `except Exception`. Consider handling specific exceptions (like `yt_dlp.DownloadError`) separately.
- The Go error handling in `services/video/service.go` could benefit from more detailed error types for different failure scenarios.

# Resource Management

- Consider implementing resource cleanup for temporary files in Python scripts, especially if the process fails midway.
- The SQLite database might benefit from connection pooling configuration in `repository/sqlite/db.go`.
- Add proper cleanup of downloaded files and audio processing artifacts.

# Security

- URL validation could be strengthened to prevent potential abuse.
- Consider adding rate limiting per IP address instead of just global rate limiting.
- Add input sanitization for user-provided URLs before passing to yt-dlp.

# Performance

- The polling interval in `formHandler.js` is fixed at 1 second. Consider implementing exponential backoff.
- Large transcriptions might cause memory issues. Consider implementing streaming or pagination.
- Could add caching for frequently requested videos.

# Configuration

- Environment variables could be more strictly validated.
- Some hardcoded values could be moved to configuration.
- Python script paths could be made more configurable.

# Dependencies

- The Go version (1.23) specified in the Dockerfile doesn't exist yet (latest is 1.22).
- Consider pinning specific versions of Python packages in `pyproject.toml`.
- Add version constraints for Go dependencies.

# Monitoring/Logging

- Add more structured logging throughout the application.
- Consider adding metrics for monitoring transcription times, success rates, etc.
- Add proper logging rotation configuration.

# Testing

- No tests are included. Add unit and integration tests.
- Add mock implementations for external services.
- Add proper test coverage for error scenarios.

# Frontend

- Add proper error handling for network failures.
- Add input validation feedback before submission.
- Consider adding progress indicators for long transcriptions.

# Docker

- Add proper health checks for the Python services.
- Consider using multi-stage builds to reduce image size.
- Add volume mounts for persistent data.
