# Project Status

**Last Updated**: 2025-08-22  
**Current Phase**: Litestar Implementation Complete  
**Next Milestone**: Testing and Deployment

## Current State

### What Exists
- ✅ Pure Python Litestar application
- ✅ yt-dlp integration for downloads
- ✅ Multiple transcription backends (whisper.cpp, MLX, OpenAI API, fallback)
- ✅ SQLModel database models with async SQLAlchemy
- ✅ Service layer architecture with dependency injection
- ✅ Comprehensive API endpoints with WebSocket support
- ✅ Caching layer with diskcache
- ✅ CLI script for standalone usage
- ✅ AI-optimized documentation structure

### Known Issues
- ❌ No unit tests implemented yet
- ❌ Docker setup needs updating for new structure
- ❌ Rate limiting not fully implemented
- ❌ Static frontend needs updating for new API
- ❌ Production deployment configuration needed

## Migration Status

### Phase 1: Documentation ✅
- Created new documentation structure
- Defined technical specification
- Established migration plan

### Phase 2: Setup ✅
- [x] Initialize new Python project structure
- [x] Set up uv and pyproject.toml
- [x] Configure Litestar application
- [ ] Set up testing framework

### Phase 3: Core Implementation ✅
- [x] Port API endpoints to Litestar
- [x] Implement whisper.cpp integration
- [x] Add mlx-whisper for development
- [x] Migrate database models to SQLModel
- [x] Create service layer architecture
- [x] Implement backend factory pattern
- [x] Add dependency injection

### Phase 4: Optimization
- [ ] Add streaming audio processing
- [ ] Implement caching layer
- [ ] Add rate limiting
- [ ] Optimize Docker image

### Phase 5: Deployment
- [ ] Configure Railway/Fly deployment
- [ ] Set up monitoring
- [ ] Document deployment process
- [ ] Performance testing

## Active Work

**Current Task**: Testing new implementation  
**Blocked By**: None  
**Next Steps**: 
1. Test basic functionality
2. Fix any startup issues
3. Deploy to development environment

## Performance Metrics

### Current (Go/Python)
- Memory Usage: ~4GB with model loaded
- Startup Time: ~15 seconds
- Docker Image: 2.5GB

### Target (Pure Python)
- Memory Usage: <2GB
- Startup Time: <5 seconds  
- Docker Image: <500MB

## Decision Log

**2025-08-22**: Decided to migrate from Go/Python to pure Python with Litestar
- Rationale: Simplifies architecture, single language, better for portfolio
- Impact: Complete rewrite but cleaner codebase

**2025-08-22**: Chose whisper.cpp over faster-whisper for production
- Rationale: Better accuracy, lower memory usage with quantized models
- Impact: Need to implement wrapper, but better VPS compatibility

**2025-08-22**: Completed Litestar migration implementation
- Rationale: Full rewrite provides cleaner architecture and better patterns
- Impact: All core functionality implemented, ready for testing
