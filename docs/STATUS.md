# Project Status

**Last Updated**: 2025-08-22  
**Current Phase**: Architecture Migration Planning  
**Next Milestone**: Litestar MVP

## Current State

### What Exists
- ✅ Working Go/Python hybrid application
- ✅ yt-dlp integration for downloads
- ✅ Basic transcription with faster-whisper
- ✅ SQLite database for job tracking
- ✅ Docker setup for development
- ✅ Static HTML frontend

### Known Issues
- ❌ Accuracy issues with faster-whisper
- ❌ Complex Go/Python communication overhead
- ❌ No tests for Go or Python code
- ❌ Memory usage not optimized for small VPS
- ❌ No rate limiting implementation

## Migration Status

### Phase 1: Documentation ✅
- Created new documentation structure
- Defined technical specification
- Established migration plan

### Phase 2: Setup (Current)
- [ ] Initialize new Python project structure
- [ ] Set up uv and pyproject.toml
- [ ] Configure Litestar application
- [ ] Set up testing framework

### Phase 3: Core Implementation
- [ ] Port API endpoints to Litestar
- [ ] Implement whisper.cpp integration
- [ ] Add mlx-whisper for development
- [ ] Migrate database models to SQLModel

### Phase 4: Optimization
- [ ] Add streaming audio processing
- [ ] Implement caching layer
- [ ] Add rate limiting
- [ ] Optimize Docker image

### Phase 5: Deployment
- [ ] Configure Railway/Fly deployment
- [ ] Set up monitoring
- [ ] Document deployment process
- [ ] Performance testing

## Active Work

**Current Task**: Creating documentation structure  
**Blocked By**: None  
**Next Steps**: 
1. Complete documentation hierarchy
2. Commit current changes
3. Begin project restructure

## Performance Metrics

### Current (Go/Python)
- Memory Usage: ~4GB with model loaded
- Startup Time: ~15 seconds
- Docker Image: 2.5GB

### Target (Pure Python)
- Memory Usage: <2GB
- Startup Time: <5 seconds  
- Docker Image: <500MB

## Decision Log

**2025-08-22**: Decided to migrate from Go/Python to pure Python with Litestar
- Rationale: Simplifies architecture, single language, better for portfolio
- Impact: Complete rewrite but cleaner codebase

**2025-08-22**: Chose whisper.cpp over faster-whisper for production
- Rationale: Better accuracy, lower memory usage with quantized models
- Impact: Need to implement wrapper, but better VPS compatibility
