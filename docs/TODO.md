## 🎯 Next Priority

1. **Testing** - Add comprehensive test suite
2. **Docker** - Update containers for new structure
3. **Frontend** - Update UI to work with new API
4. **Deployment** - Configure for production VPS

## 📝 Notes

**Performance Results**:
- Successfully transcribed 142-second video in 19.7 seconds
- MLX Whisper working on Apple Silicon
- Memory usage under 2GB during transcription

**Architecture Decisions**:
- Pure Python with Litestar (no more Go)
- Multiple transcription backends with fallback
- Async throughout with proper dependency injection
- Service layer pattern for clean separation

**Known Limitations**:
- Rate limiting not fully implemented
- No authentication system yet
- Docker images need updating
- Frontend needs API updates
