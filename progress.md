# YT-Text Project Build Progress

## Current Status

We've successfully fixed the Docker build issues in the yt-text project. The application now builds and runs both the Go backend server and Python transcription service in a single Docker environment with gRPC communication between them.

## Build Issues Resolved

1. **Go Import Path Problems**: Fixed the import path issue with protobuf files by updating the replace directive in go.mod and ensuring proper module paths in the Docker build.

2. **Docker Integration**: Reintegrated the Go backend into the Docker setup with a multi-stage build process that correctly handles both Go and Python components.

3. **Missing Git in Docker**: Fixed the Docker build failure by adding git to the Alpine image dependencies, enabling Go module downloads.

4. **Go Module Issues**: Fixed issues with Go module imports of Google's protobuf and genproto packages by updating the package versions and replace directive structure.

## Solutions Implemented

1. **Updated Docker Configuration**: Created a multi-stage Docker build that handles both Go and Python services:
   - First stage builds the Go application with proper module handling
   - Second stage builds Python dependencies
   - Final stage combines both services in a single container

2. **Fixed Module Replace Directive**: Updated the Go module replace directive to handle imports correctly in both local and Docker environments:
   ```go
   replace yt-text/protos => ./protos
   ```

3. **Explicit Go Build Parameters**: Added explicit build parameters to ensure module path resolution works correctly:
   ```
   go build -v -mod=mod -o /bin/yt-text .
   ```

4. **Reintegrated Go Backend**: Uncommented and updated the Go application service in docker-compose.yml to use the newly built binary.

5. **Fixed Structured Logging and Error Handling**: Updated the Go code to use proper structured logging with zerolog throughout the codebase, and improved error handling to use Fiber's built-in error functionality.

6. **Previously Implemented**:
   - Updated to Go 1.24 in both local and production environments
   - Fixed gRPC dependencies by explicitly installing them with uv
   
7. **Missing Git Dependency**: Updated both local and production Dockerfiles to add git to the Alpine image:
   ```
   RUN apk add --no-cache gcc musl-dev git
   ```

## Docker Configuration

Current Docker setup:
- **Combined Container**: A single Docker image that contains both the Go binary and Python environment
- **Multiple Services**: Using docker-compose to run two services from the same image:
  - Go backend server on port 8080
  - Python gRPC service on port 50051
- **Environment Setup**: Using Python 3.12 and Go 1.24 with CGO enabled for SQLite support

## Next Steps

1. **End-to-End Testing**: Implement tests to verify the complete workflow between the Go backend and Python gRPC service.

2. **Fix Failing Python Tests**: Address the failing tests in the Python transcription module:
   - `test_close_method`: Fix CUDA cache clearing detection in tests
   - `test_download_audio_success`: Fix file extension mismatch (.wav vs .mp4)
   - `test_manage_cache_size`: Update test expectations for file deletions

3. **CI/CD Pipeline Updates**: Ensure the Docker build process works correctly in the CI/CD pipeline.

4. **Documentation Updates**: Update documentation to reflect the new build and run process.

## Technical Context

### Repository Structure
- `/app`: Go backend server with WebSockets for real-time updates
- `/docker`: Docker configuration files
  - `/local`: Development Docker configuration
  - `/fly`: Fly.io deployment configuration
- `/python`: Python scripts for transcription (gRPC service)
- `/static`: Frontend assets with WebSocket UI integration

### Go Application
- Built with Go 1.24
- Uses Fiber for the web framework
- Communicates with the Python gRPC service
- Requires CGO_ENABLED=1 for SQLite support

### Python Service
- Uses Python 3.12 
- Dependencies managed with uv package manager
- Implements the gRPC service for transcription
- Uses whisper-based transcription with memory optimizations
- Streaming audio processing with pydub

### Build Commands
- Go build: `cd app && CGO_ENABLED=1 go build -v -o yt-text ./...`
- Docker build: `docker-compose -f docker/local/docker-compose.yml build`
- Run Docker: `docker-compose -f docker/local/docker-compose.yml up`
